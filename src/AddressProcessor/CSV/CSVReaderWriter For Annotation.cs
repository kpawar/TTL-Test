        1) List three to five key concerns with this implementation that you would discuss with the junior developer. 

        Please leave the rest of this file as it is so we can discuss your concerns during the next stage of the interview process.
        
        *1) Combining the read and write responsiblities is not a good idea as it leads to frequent refactoring and increased maintenance due to the dependencies.
        * This also violates the Single Responsibility principle and may further encourage more methods to be added which are not necessarily
        * the job of this class
        *2) No interfaces which means this class is tightly coupled to its dependent classes. If you wanted to introduce a different implementation, you 
        * would have to change it in all the dependencies. Having an interface allows you to change in just one place. 
        *3) Unit tests for this class are required. Also given there is no interface, it can't be mocked and writing clean tests with full coverage is not possible. 
        *4) The error handling in the Open method is insufficient. It caters for only when the mode has not been set leaving room for unhandled exceptions
        *5) Potential memory leak issue if there is an exception before the close method is called. Consider a using statement in each method that uses the stream.
        *6) The write method can be cleaner by using the string.join extension
